Project Members: Jingchao Zhou, Simran Regmi

Learning Objectives:
1. Provide an introduction to AWS services, particularly SageMaker: This objective is being achieved by this assignment as those who complete it have to utilize SageMaker to implement and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
2. Learn how to use PyTorch and Keras on Cloud Platforms: This objective is being achieved by this assignment as those who complete it have to utilize PyTorch to run their training function as a training job on SageMaker infrastructure and Keras when using Google Cloud Platform.
3. Understand how cloud computing works and why it's relevant to machine learning: This objective is being achieved by this assignment as those who complete it will ultimately understand how using cloud computing services make the model creation and deployment much more efficient and simpler.
4. How to import data from and store data to S3: This objective is being achieved by this assignment as those who complete it will have to use S3 to store the dataset that powers their model training process.
5. Learn how to set up a Jupyter notebook on GCP
6. How to implement and train a CNN model on the MNIST dataset: This objective is being achieved by this assignment as the main purpose of this assignment is to ultimately implement and train a CNN model on the MNIST dataset.
